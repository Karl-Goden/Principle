This document will explain why Guido is so stupid. The reason
is i don't undersatand a python module which is written by my
cross-peacific colleague (including venv, pyinstaller, cffi,
decorator, let alone a series of tricky classes all of which i
have never heared before), since i must extend this module,
i decide to deep into python thoroughly to see why python is 
designed so disguisting (at least for me at present).

1) Module and Packege: module is a .py file, package is a directory
   containing an __init__.py file which declares which module's
   which object can be exported. Just like a directory is a file,
   package is also used as a module through import directive.
   a) Module path is: current dir, built-in dir, built-in/site-packages.
   b) Modules in a package is independent, so we should use module's
      full name in import even two module share a package. At the first
	  sight it seems redundant, but from the point of view of external,
	  this mechanism expresent a simple find method. And __init__ should
	  also import module's full name since package is just a general module.
   c) __all__ can be used to export object by ‘from m import *’
   d) module name __name__ is "__main__" if current module is being executed.
	  Otherwise, i.e., if it is imported, the name if full name of module.

2) Magic Method: __new__ is equivalent to operator new in C++, it is a
   staticmethod, __init__ is equivalent to constructor function in C++, it is
   executed only after the object is created by __new__. When we call __new__
   and then receive this created object, we automatically invoke __init__.
   __del__ is equivalent to destructor function in C++ against to __init__.
   __enter__ and __exit__ is context manager which is used in with statement.

3) MRO: method resolution order
   1) old-style: depth-first left-to-right
   2) new-style: a) subclass must before baseclass
                 b) left baseclass must before right baseclass
				 c) non class should be visited more than once
		In hierarchy: class A; class B(A); class C(A, B);
		Report a TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
		since for class C's mro, A must before B for rule-b, and B must
		before A for rule-a, so it is a conflict.
   3) Super and revisiting new and init:
	   super(A, B): return A's super class in mro of B, i.e., the next
	   object or type of A in linearization of B's mro, if B is a type
	   return a class type, else return an object. A is current class
	   __class__, B is the first argument of current function.
	   We show a multi-inheritence relationship:
	   class A; class B(A); class C(B, A); class D(C);
	   the mro of D is [D, C, B, A]
	   
	    class Car: // A singleton
          _instance = None
          def __new__(cls):
            if cls._instance is None:
  		      cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            return cls._instance

   4) Different between classmethod and staticmethod:
		classmethod has an implicit argument(by decorator @classmethod),
		i.e. class type, which is the class who is called on the method.
		that is the defined class or its subclass.
		staticmethod has no implicit argument. For example: __new___ is 
		a static method, so we should pass cls explicitly:
		def __new__(cls):
			return super().__new__(cls);
		In this code, super's return is also passed as argument.
		
		Python is a dynamic-type language, type-checking is on runtime,
		so every class method resolution is executed at runtime, if we
		can identify which class is choosed, we would invoke the associated
		function, so class type is impilicitly passing in any method,
		(regardless of classmethod, staticmethod or objectmethod).
		
4) * and **:
   1) pass argument list and dict as by position and by name
   2) receive parameter as list and dict for by position and by name

   _ and __:
   _ prefix cannot be imported by 'from module import *'.
   __prefix is mangled by prefix __class in order not to be used accidently by subclass.

   is and ==: 'is' is pysically equal, '==' is logically equal.

   
6) Type:
   1) Builtin Type: list, tuple, set, dict
   2) collections:
        namedtuple('Card', ['rank', 'suite']);
   3) typing:
		template like list used as type annotation before 3.9 should be declared as 'List'.
		Any

8) cffi: C foreign function interface
   a) dynamic
       from cffi import FFI;
	   ffi = FFI();
	   ffi.cdef('int printf(const char*, ...)'); // to match the dll function
	   dll = ffi.dllopen(None); // open std libc
	   dll.printf(b"hello %s\n", ffi.new("char[]", b"world"));
   b) static
       from cffi import FFI;
	   ffi = FFI();
	   ffi.set_source(module_name, "", sources=[], libraries=[], include	-dirs=[], library-dirs=[]);
	   ffi.cdef(...);
	   
	   from module_name import ffi, lib
	   lib.call_function();
